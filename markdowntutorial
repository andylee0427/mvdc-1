##A Brief Introduction to Markdown

If you've ever wondered why some pieces of texts are littered with hashtags and asterixes it is probably
because you are looking at something called Markdown. Markdown is a way of adding styling information (bold, italic, size etc.)
to the very text itself. Created by John Gruber in 2004, its use has become widespread, being now built-in to sites like 
Reddit and Github. This tutorial is meant to introduce a basic understanding of Markdown literacy through teaching how to 
make headings and give emphasis to text.

###Headings

Headings are denoted by the # sign and get smaller according to amount of # signs you use.

# - H1
## - H2
### - H3
#### - H4
##### - H5
###### - H6

Here are some examples of them in action:

####Voila! Weren't headers easy?!

###Emphasis

Giving emphasis to words through bold and italic is a crucial part of writing and here's how you do it in Markdown:

Italics are done with one asterix on either side like so: *MAKE ME ITALIAN*
Bold is done with two asterixes on either side: **MAKE ME BOLD**
If you wanna go wild and do ITALICS and BOLD then put double asterixes and underscores around the desired word: **_SO MUCH EMPHASIS_**
Lastly let's say you really want to just cross something out, you might want to use a strike through,
made by putting two tildes on either side of the word/sentance: ~~no longer a thing~~

Now practice your Markdown emphasis by giving the noted emphasis to the sentance below:

The [quick brown fox] [BOLD THIS] [decides to change the age-old coding practice line and] [STRIKETHROUGH THIS] jumps 
[back] [STRIKETHROUGH THIS] over the [lazy] [BOLD + ITALICS] dog.

Hope that the tutorial was helpful and stay **bold**!
