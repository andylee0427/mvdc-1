Hidden files are called "dot"  .  files
These start with .  

for example: “.bash_history” is the syntax for a dot file name.

Navigate to the directory you want using `cd`

To see a list of the hidden files go to command line and type: 
`ls -aa`

Then type:

`open .[file name]` 

The file will open in a text editor.
